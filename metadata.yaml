description: COOKERY / FOOD & DRINK ETC. A rapturous appreciation of pork crackling,
  a touching description of hungry London chimney sweeps, a discussion of the strange
  pleasure of eating pineapple and a meditation on the delights of Christmas feasting
  are just some of the subjects of these personal, playful writings from early nineteenth-century
  essayist Charles Lamb. Exploring the joys of food and also our complicated social
  relationship with it, these essays are by turns sensuous, mischievous, lyrical and
  self-mocking. Filled with a sense of hunger, they are some of the most fascinating
  and nuanced works ever written about eating, drinking and appetite. Throughout the
  history of civilization, food has been more than simple necessity. In countless
  cultures, it has been livelihood, status symbol, entertainment - and passion. In
  the "Great Food" series, Penguin brings you the finest food writing from the last
  400 years, and opens the door to the wonders of every kitchen.
